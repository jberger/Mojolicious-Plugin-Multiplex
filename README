The original protocol (extended below) was proposed by SockJS, seen here: https://github.com/sockjs/websocket-multiplex

The underlying protocol is quite simple. Each message is a string consisting of three comma separated parts: type, topic and payload. There are three valid message types:

sub - expresses a will to subscribe to a given topic.
msg - a message with payload is being sent on a topic.
uns - a will to unsubscribe from a topic.
err - a message with a payload that is emitted as an error
ack - a message stating whether the other party believes you are subscribed to the topic
      the playload is either "true" or "false"
      this message is sent as a response to sub/uns messages

Invalid messages like wrong unsubscriptions or publishes to a topic to which a client was not subscribed to are simply ignored.
